         Started with the plan to connect family members online through this website, I then expanded its reach to the far off relatives and kins who had always been 
           an integral part of the family. The audience was then further increased to include the friends and mates into the aura.<br />
           bindrafamily.com now includes specific albums for every type of user where the users log in with the provided passphrases and visit the albums and then the appropriate 
           albums are accessible to them. Keeping privacy in mind this website is developed with high standards of security and was tested by professionals. GUI of the website is 
           very interactive and responsive. A new user can easily understand and soon starts enjoying the smooth flow and transistions of the website.
           <br />
           A <strong>million memories</strong> which hold us all together and the warmth of love for each other makes it possible to maintain the relationships. 
       <br /><br />    <em>Love your family. Spend time, be kind & serve one another. Make no room for regrets. Tomorrow is not promised & today is short.</em>
